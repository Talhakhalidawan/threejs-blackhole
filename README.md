=======
My attempt at building realtime blackhole ray tracer, 
reproducing [[1]](http://rantonels.github.io/starless/) and [[2]](https://github.com/oseiskar/black-hole).  
They helped me a lot since I am by no means a physicist nor an expert programmer.  

I was fascinated by the idea of ray tracing blackhole with now popularized accretion disk around it. So I hopped in.  
  
You can drag with your mouse to look around.



this may be a work-in-progess project(?).
