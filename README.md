This is still a work-in-progess project.

My attempt at building realtime blackhole ray tracer, 
reproducing [1](http://rantonels.github.io/starless/) and [2](https://github.com/oseiskar/black-hole).  
They helped me a lot since I am by no means a physicist nor an expert programmer.  

I was fascinated by the idea of ray tracing blackhole with popular accretion disk around it. So I hopped in.

I left links to almost all of the websites that I visited while learning in order to progress in other markdown files.
