Using certain values for variables, we can simplify the equation to:  
<img src="https://tex.s2cms.ru/svg/%5Cvec%20F(r)%20%3D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D%20h%5E2%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Chat%20r%7D%7Br%5E5%7D" alt="\vec F(r) = - \frac{3}{2} h^2 \frac{\hat r}{r^5}" />
(*h* is some constant and hat denotes unit vector)

In Binet Equation, r denotes the position of a particle. For example, a photon.     
F(r) is force applied to the particle.

Integrate above equation for parameterized geodesic equation:
